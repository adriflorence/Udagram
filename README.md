## Getting started

Provision the necessary AWS services needed for running the application:

1. In AWS, provision a publicly available RDS database running Postgres.
2. In AWS, provision a s3 bucket for hosting the uploaded files.
3. Export the ENV variables needed or use [dotnev](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).
4. From the root of the repo, navigate udagram-api folder `cd starter/udagram-api` to install the node_modules `npm install`. After installation is done start the api in dev mode with `npm run dev`.
5. Without closing the terminal in step 1, navigate to the udagram-frontend `cd starter/udagram-frontend` to intall the node_modules `npm install`. After installation is done start the api in dev mode with `npm run start`.
